Parameter Name    : "SERIAL"

Brief             : First Call the "get-transports-data " which will return JSON as the required format the JSON
                    returned does contain multiple records and you have to loop on each one while in loop process
                    insert process accrued after insert a successful insert directly call the "set-transports-post-date"
                    link so you close the record at scale system so you do not receive it again and for precaution
                    you have to check before insert if the SERIAL is exist in your system if exists
                    call "set-transports-post-date" link if not do your process

                    when the response 'status' = true and response code 200 then the raw is actually closed
                         the response response code = 404 then the raw is not successful closed
